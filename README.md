# Java-2
My Second Java Project! (Quiz)

First, it will ask weather you want to play the game or not; if yes, it will print out "Okay, let's go", whereas if no, it will print out "Alright, bye!" and terminate the program. 

If continued, it will ask questions like...

1. Is Python a creature or a programming language?
2. What is a double in Java, C#, C and C++?
3. What is HTML used for?

and more :)
